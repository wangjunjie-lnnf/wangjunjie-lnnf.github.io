# VHDL基础

> VHDL is a powerful hardware description language. It can be used for both circuit synthesis and circuit simulation. In the case of synthesis (construction), the language describes the desired behavior or structure of a digital unit, from which a compliant physical circuit is inferred by the compiler. In the case of simulation (testing), the language generates stimuli and applies them to the designed (coded) circuit, subsequently verifying its behavior by comparing the obtained responses against expected results, immensely easing the verification (and documentation) of the circuit under development.

VHDL既能用于综合，描述电路的行为和结构，又能用于仿真，测试验证电路的行为

## 代码结构

![vhdl-structure](/assets/images/2024-02-14/vhdl-structure.png)

> On the left is the design entity (our VHDL code), which is composed of two parts, called entity declaration and architecture body. The code starts with a list of all packages needed to process that design. On the right is the other design unit, the package, which is also composed of two parts, called package declaration and package body (the latter might not be required). 

VHDL的代码结构如上图：包含package、entity、architecture

* **Packages list:** Consists of a list with the names of all packages (and libraries of origin) needed in the design. Package standard, from the std library, is an exception because it is always visible by default. 

* **Entity declaration:** Describes how the design entity (VHDL code) interfaces with the external environment. For that purpose, all circuit ports are named and specified. A port can communicate, for example, with a design located in another device, in which case the port uses device pin(s). The entity declaration allows also the inclusion of generic constants (among other generic items).

* **Architecture body:** Contains the VHDL code proper, which describes the circuit behavior or structure, from which a compliant hardware can then be inferred by the compiler. The architecture body is the internal description of the entity declaration.

* **Package declaration:** This portion of a package contains only declarations, which can be declarations of subprograms, types, subtypes, signals, constants, components, aliases, and several other items. 

* **Package body:** If **Package declaration** contains a declaration of subprogram or deferred constant (a constant with unspecified value), the package body must contain the corresponding subprogram body and/or the constant's value or its value definition mechanism.

**Packages list**类似C语言的`#include <xxx.h>`，引入外部的类型声明；**Entity declaration**类似C语言的函数声明语句，指定函数名以及参数和返回值的名称和类型；**Architecture body**类似C语言的函数定义，指定函数的实现逻辑。示例如下：

```VHDL
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity add_compare_cell is
    port (
        a, b: in std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
        comp: out std_logic;
        sum: out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)
    );
end entity;

architecture dataflow of add_compare_cell is
    signal a_uns, b_uns: unsigned(3 downto 0);
begin
    a_uns <= unsigned('0' & a);
    b_uns <= unsigned('0' & b);
    comp <= '1' when a_uns > b_uns else '0';
    sum <= std_logic_vector(a_uns + b_uns);
end architecture;
```

### Libraries and Packages

> The main official VHDL packages are distributed in two libraries called std and ieee. 

> **Packages from the std library**
* Package standard: Defines the standard types bit, bit_vector, integer, boolean, character, and so on and a number of related operators plus other functions.
* Package textio: For dealing with text and files.
* Package env: For communication with the simulation environment.

> **Packages from the ieee library**
* Package std_logic_1164: A very important package, which defines the nine-value type std_ulogic, along with its array version, the std_ulogic_vector type. It also includes the related subtypes std_logic and std_logic_vector, respectively. Its main feature, compared to the original type bit, is the existence of the additional synthesizable values **don't care ('-') and high-impedance ('Z')** (type bit only allows '0' and '1').

**standard**包定义了标准类型bit等及其相关的操作，**std_logic_1164**包定义了增强类型**std_logic and std_logic_vector**等。  

一个package的示例如下：

```VHDL
use std.textio.all;

package std_logic_1164 is

    --Types and subtypes:
    type std_ulogic is (...);
    type std_ulogic_vector is array (natural range <>) of std_ulogic;
    subtype std_logic is resolved std_ulogic;
    subtype std_logic_vector is (resolved) std_ulogic_vector;
    ...

    --Logical operators:
    function "and" (L, R: std_ulogic_vector) return std_ulogic_vector;
    function "and" (L: std_ulogic_vector; R: std_ulogic) return std_ulogic_vector;
    ...

end package std_logic_1164;

package body std_logic_1164 is
    function "and" (L, R: std_ulogic_vector) return std_ulogic_vector is
        variable result: std_ulogic_vector (1 to L'length);
        ...
    begin
        if (L'length /= R'length) then
            assert false ...
        else
            for i in result'range loop
                result(i) := and_table(...);
            end loop;
        end if;

        return result;
    end function "and";
    ...
end package body std_logic_1164;
```

### Packages List

> A VHDL code starts with a list of all packages needed to process the design. To make a package visible to the compiler, a **library** clause plus a **use** clause pointing to the specific package of that library are needed. This can be done as shown below, where the keyword all causes all elements of that package to be visible. Though not used routinely, it is also possible to point to just a particular member of a package.

```VHDL
library library_name;
use library_name.package_name.all;
```

默认引入的库和包如下，work表示当前项目：

```VHDL
library std, work;
use std.standard.all;
```

示例如下：

```VHDL
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;
use work.functions_pkg.all;
-- 只引入指定名称sort
use work.procedures_pkg.sort;
```

> The libraries/packages used most frequently are:
* Package standard from the std library (visible by default);
* Library work (project directory; synthesis and simulation files are visible automatically, packages are not);
* Package std_logic_1164, from the ieee library;
* Package numeric_std, also from the ieee library.


### Entity Declaration

```VHDL
entity entity_name is
    [generic (
        constant_name: constant_type [:= constant_value];
        constant_name: constant_type [:= constant_value];
        ...);]

    port (
        port_name: port_mode port_type;
        port_name: port_mode port_type;
        ...);
end [entity] [entity-name];
```

> The main parts of an entity declaration (or entity, for short) are the generic and port clauses (together, they form the entity header). The former is optional, while the latter is mandatory for synthesis (empty entities occur in testbenches, which are for simulation).

* **Generic list:** lt is used for declaring global constants (plus other items), so parameterized codes can be easily written, which is important for code maintenance, readability, and reusability. Such constants can be used immediately in the next part of the entity, which is the port list. 

* **Port list:** The second region in the syntax above is the port list, which is just a list with specifications of all circuit inputs and outputs. The first specification for a port is a name for it. The second specification is the port mode, which can be in, out, or inout (after VHDL-2008, mode buffer finally became unnecessary). The final specification is the port type, which can be any of the predefined VHDL types (bit, integer, std_logic_vector, etc.) or a user-defined type.

**Generic list**是可选的，包含一组全局常量的定义；**Port list**是必选的，指定了端口的名称、默认和类型。示例如下：

```VHDL
entity SRAM_interface is
    generic(
        ADDR_WIDTH: natural := 16;
        DATA_WIDTH: natural := 8);
    port(
        we: out std_logic;
        addr: out std_logic_vector(ADDR_WIDTH-l downto 0);
        data: inout std_logic_vector(DATA_WIDTH-l downto 0));
end entity SRAM_interface;
```

上述是常规的entity结构，entity也可以包含一些其他部分：

```VHDL
entity entity_name is
    [generic(...);]
    port(...);
    [entity_declarative_part]
[begin
    entity_statement_part]
end [entity] [entity_name];
```

> The **declarative part** can contain the same kinds of declarations and specifications allowed in the declarative part of the **architecture**, except for **component declarations and configuration specifications**. The statement part can contain concurrent assertion statements and passive procedure calls (these do not involve signal assignments and are used, for example, for testing port values in simulation).

```VHDL
entity ... is
    generic(.. .);
    port(...);

    function find_max(...) return integer is
        variable result: integer ...;
    begin
        ...
    end function;
begin
    assert ...;
    check_delay(...);
end entity ...;
```

### Architecture Body

> The architecture body (or architecture, for short) contains the VHDL code proper, which describes the circuit behavior or structure, from which a compliant hardware can then be inferred by the compiler. It can also contain instances of previous designs. It is composed of two parts, the first being a declarative region and the second a statement region, as shown below.

```VHDL
architecture architecture_name of entity_name is
    [architecture_declarative_part]
begin
    architecture_statement_part
end [architecture] [architecture_name];
```

* **Declarative part:** This region, located before the keyword begin, can contain declarations of subprogram (with subprogram body), package (with package body, if needed), type, subtype, constant, signal, shared variable, file, alias, component, attribute, and group. It can also contain configuration and disconnection specifications plus use clauses. The most popular declarations are of types, signals, and constants. 

* **Statement part:** This region is where the VHDL statements (the code proper) are placed. In other words, here is where the circuits are built. 

**architecture**类似C语言的源文件，也可以声明和定义各种内部使用的类型，同时实现函数的具体功能


### Object Classes

> An object is a named item that has a value of a type. There are four object classes in VHDL: constant, signal, variable, and file. 

```VHDL
architecture ... of ... is
    constant CLK_FREQ: natural := 50_000_000;
    signal data_ready: std_logic;
begin
    ...
    process(clk)
        variable count: natural range 0 to CLK_FREQ;
    begin
        ...
    end process;
end architecture;
```

---

* **Constant** Members of the constant class have a staticvalue. A constant can be declared (created) in the declarative part of entity, architecture, package, block, generate, process, or subprogram. Its syntax is shown below.

`constant constant_name: constant_type := constant_value;`

> The use of constants is important for several reasons. First, it makes the code more readable because, contrary to numeric values, a constant has a (meaningful) name. Second, it avoids the use of numeric values or related expressions inside the code, which can be messy. Finally it reduces the effort and, more importantly, prevents errors when the value of a constant must be modified, which is particularlycritical when that value appears more than once in the code.

> A constant declared using the syntax above is said to be an explicitly declared constant. A constant can also be declared without a value, as shown below; then it is called a deferred constant.

`constant constant_name: constant_type;`

> A deferred constant is important when its value depends on the application. In this case, it can be declared in a package, with its value then defined in the package body using, for example, a function call with parameters passed by the application. The constant's value can be omitted also when a constant is in a generic list of a design that is instantiated as a component in another design, so its value is defined at instantiation time.

常量用于提高代码的可读性和可维护性，声明时可以不指定值，示例如下：

```VHDL
constant NUM_BITS: natural := 16;
constant DEPTH: natural := 2**NUM_BITS;
constant CLK_FREQ_MHZ: natural := l50;
constant MASK: std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := "00001111";
```

---

* **Signal** Members of the signal class are capable of passing values in and out of the circuit as well as between its internal parts. In other words, signals represent wires. All elements of the port list of an entity declaration belong to this class.

signal表示wire，组件之间的连线，用于在组件之间传递值

> Signal declarations can be made in the declarative part of entity, architecture, package, block, and generate. Signals cannot be declared in sequential code (i.e., process and subprograms), though their values can be modified there. Its syntax is shown below.

`signal signal_name: signal_type [:= default_value];`

> The default value is optional; if not included, an implicit value is assumed, which is the type's leftmost value-for example, for integers it is the range's left bound, and for enumeration types it is the first element in the list.

signal的默认值是可选的，如果忽略则取对应类型的值列表的最左侧的值

> Even though default values for signals might be useful for simulation, that is hardly so for synthesis, because physical initialization is rarely possible. For example, say that we want to implement a circuit that computes `sum = a + b;`, how can we give a default value to sum if there is no memory and the value of sum depends entirely on a and b? (The default value would be ignored by the compiler.) Besides being often inappropriate, another problem with explicit default values for signals is that they can send a wrong message to an unaware reader, who might believe that that indeed occurs. In summary, default values for signals should be avoided in code that is for synthesis.

signal最后不要指定默认值，默认值无法被综合

```VHDL
--Signal declarations:
signal elk, rst, data_in: std_logic;
signal address: natural range 0 to 255;

--Signal assignments:
if rst then reg <= 'e';
if rst then reg <= (others => '0');
outp <= inp when ena else (others => 'Z');
```

---

* **Variable** Variables are a major feature of VHDL. They are used solely in sequential code, where they are updated immediately, thus recommended for implementing particularly circuits that involve counters and loops.

> A variable can be declared (created) only in the declarative region of a process or subprogram. Its syntax is shown below.

`variable variable_name: variable_type [:= initial_value];`

variable只能用在时序代码中，在process或subprogram中声明，示例如下：

```VHDL
variable count: natural range 0 to 2**NUM_BITS-1;

if rising_edge(clk) then
    count := count + 1;
end if;
```

有一种变量叫共享变量，可以被多个process访问，语法如下：

`shared variable shared_variable_name : shared_variable_type;`

> A shared variable can be declared in the declarative region of package (with restrictions), entity, architecture, block, and generate. Its type has to be a protected type. Shared variables are intended for simulation. Though some compilers offer some synthesis support, they should be avoided because they are often a source of confusion, and anyway they do not add any relevant help to the construction of codes for synthesis.

共享变量应该尽量避免使用，主要用于仿真，容易引起歧义

---

* **File** It is not for synthesis but for simulation.


### Entity-Architecture Binding

> During development or simulation, one might want to write several experimental architectures for the same entity. Since only one entity-architecture pair can be processed at a time, it is necessary to inform which architecture should be picked. For that, the configuration declaration below can be used. A configuration declaration must be located outside any entity or architecture.

```VHDL
configuration configuration_name of entity_name is
    for architecture_name
    end for;
end [configuration] [configuration_name];
```

entity和architecture是一对多关系，但是每次必须选择一个，configuration用于选择每个entity的architecture，示例如下：

```VHDL
entity test is
    ...
end entity test;

architecture arch1 of test is
    ...
end architecture arch1;

architecture arch2 of test is
    ...
end architecture arch2;

-- 使用configuration指定有效的architecture
configuration config of test is
    for arch1 end for;
end configuration;

-- entity实例化时指定architecture
comp: entity work.test(arch1) port map (...);
```


## 预定义数据类型

> VHDL is said to be a strongly typed language because of several features: it does not allow data transfer between objects of different types (even if the type declarations, except for the identifiers, are exactly the same); it does not allow implicit type conversion; and every operator is constructed for specific data types. 

VHDL是强类型语言：不同类型之间没有隐式转换，不能赋值
