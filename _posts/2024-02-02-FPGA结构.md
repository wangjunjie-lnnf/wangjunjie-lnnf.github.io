# FPGA

> An FPGA is a programmable logic device, which is a type of integrated circuits that can be used to implement any digital circuit. The name of FPGA originates from the fact that a user can use a `GATE ARRAY` that is `PROGRAMMABLE` on the `FIELD` of any workplace. 

> FPGA自身就是一个集成电路，支持可编程以实现其他电路。

> The basic part of an FPGA is roughly divided into three parts. The first one consists of the logic elements (the logic block: LB) that realize logic circuits. The second is the input/output elements (the input/output block, IOB) which input and output signals to and from outside. The third is the wiring elements (the switch block, SB, and the connection block, CB) connecting LBs and IOBs. Other than that, there are a clock network, a configuration/scan chain, and a test circuit. Commercial FPGAs also contain circuits of specific functions such as processors, block memories, multipliers.

> 如上图，典型的岛式FPGA主要由3部分组成：I/O block、Logic block、Switch block。

* **Logic Element**: The major program logic implementation schemes is the lookup table (LUT), it consists of a programmable part that can be used to realize any logic circuit, a circuit that holds logic values such as flip-flop (FF) and selectors.

* **Input/Output Element**: It is a block that connects I/O pins and internal wiring elements. It also has some control circuits such as pull-up, pull-down, input/output directions, slew rate, open drain. In addition, it contains a circuit for holding values such as flip-flops. In commercial FPGAs, several standards are supported, such as LVTTL, PCI, PCIe, and SSTL which are single-ended standard I/Os and LVDS of differential standard I/O.

* **Wiring Element**: It consists of wiring channels, connection blocks (CB), and switch blocks (SB) at the connection between logical blocks and between logical blocks and I/O blocks. Besides the island style arranged in a lattice pattern, there are wiring channels of hierarchical structures, and those constituting H-trees. Each switch is programmable, and it is possible to form any wiring route by using the built-in wiring resources.

* **Other Elements**: The logical functions and connection relations of all logical blocks, I/O blocks, switch blocks, and connection blocks are determined by the configuration memory values. The configuration chain is a path to sequentially write the configuration data bits to all configuration memory modules. Basically, the configuration data are serially transferred, and both set and read back are possible. Besides the configuration chain, there are other device-scale networks such as the scan path and the clock network. Others include circuits that support LSI testing, embedded circuits for dedicated functions such as embedded processors, block memories, and multipliers.

> 如果把FPGA比作一个商场，`Logic Element`就像是一个个排列整齐的商铺，可以卖奶茶，可以卖炸鸡，可以做各种生意，`Logic Element`一般是一个查找表结构，可以实现各种布尔方程；`Input/Output Element`就像商场四面八方的出入口；`Wiring Element`就是商场内的道路，`switch blocks`是主干道，`connection blocks`是每个商铺自己的出入口；`Other Elements`好比商场内的基础设施，公厕、导航地图、消防设施等。

> The circuit on the FPGA is controlled by a programmable switch. This programmable switch can be made using various semiconductor technologies. Among these technologies, the flash memory is widely used inmodern FPGAs.

> FPGA上的电路包含很多可编程的开关，通过设置这些开关以实现特定的电路。通常使用硬件描述语言verilog等描述电路，然后编译为bitstream上传到FPGA上的flash存储，然后FPGA加载flash存储中的配置信息设置各个开关以实现指定功能。

### 使用PLA实现布尔等式

![pla-overview](/assets/images/2024-02-02/pla-overview.png)

> In the PLA (programmable logic array), an AND array and an OR array are connected and each has a programmable connection as configuration. In the product term system, in order to realize a desired circuit with fewer circuit resources, it is necessary to express the logical function in a minimum sum-of-products (SoP) form, so the simplification of the logic is very important in the design. The logic function expressed in the sum-of-products form is decomposed into the logical product term and the logical sum term which are, then, implemented in the AND array and the OR array, respectively. 

> 布尔等式简化为`sum-of-products`形式后，由`AND数组`和`OR数组`实现。

![pla-structure](/assets/images/2024-02-02/pla-structure.png)

> Within the AND array, the literal of the input signal and the input of each AND gate are connected by a programmable switch. In the OR array, the output of the AND gate and the input of the OR gate are also connected by a programmable switch. In general, in an AND array, k logical product terms of literals with up to n inputs can be programmed. In addition, the k outputs are inputted to the OR array of the next stage and it is possible to program up to m logical sum terms of the k inputs.

> 通过设置每个开关的状态可以实现投票电路。


### 使用查找表实现布尔等式

> A lookup table (LUT) is usually a memory table of 1 word 1 bit, and the number of words is determined according to the number of bits of the address. In FPGAs, SRAM is often employed for memory.

![lut-overview](/assets/images/2024-02-02/lut-overview.png)

> In general, the k-input LUT is composed of 2<sup>k</sup> bit SRAM cells and a 2k-input multiplexer. The input of the LUT is the address itself of the memory table, and it outputs 1 bit. The value of the word is determined according to this address. The k-input LUT can realize a logical function of 2 powered by 2k.

## FPGA结构

![fpga-detail](/assets/images/2024-02-02/fpga-detail.png)

> FPGA consists of three basic components: programmable logic element, programmable I/O element, and programmable interconnect element. A programmable logic element expresses a logic function, a programmable I/O element provides an external interface, and a programmable routing element connects different parts. There are also digital signal processing (DSP) units and embedded memory to increase the calculation ability, and phase-locked loop (PPL) or delay-locked loop (DLL) to provide a clock network. By downloading the design data to these elements, an FPGA can implement the desired digital circuit. An island-style FPGA has logic elements (logic block), I/O elements placed on the periphery (I/O block), routing elements (switch block, connection block, and routing channel), embedded memory, and multiplier blocks. A set of neighboring logic blocks, a connection block, a switch block is called a logic tile. In an island-style FPGA, logic tiles are arranged in a two-dimensional array. The logic block and multiplier block are used as hardware resources to realize logic functions, while the memory block provides storage. Multiplier and memory blocks, dedicated for specific usages, are called “Hard Logic,” while functions implemented with logic blocks are called “Soft Logic”.

> 上图是典型的岛式FPGA的结构图，FPGA的核心组件是：`programmable logic element`, `programmable I/O element`, `programmable interconnect element`，另外还有用于存储的内存块，以及用于计算乘法的乘法电路。


### Logic Block

![logic-element](/assets/images/2024-02-02/logic-element.png)

> A BLE consists of a LUT, an flip-flop (FF), and a selector. According to the value of the configuration memory bit M0, the selector controls whether the value of the LUT or the one stored in the FF is outputted.

> 一个逻辑块包含一个查找表、一个FF和一个selector。

> The number of LUT inputs is one of the most important factors when determining the structure of a logic block. A k-input LUT can express all k-input truth table. As the input size of the LUT increases, the total number of logical blocks decreases. On the other hand, as a k-input LUT needs 2k configuration memory bits, the area of the logic block increases. Furthermore, as the number of input/output pins of the logic block increases, the area of the routing part increases. As a result, the area per logical tile increases as well. Since the area of an FPGA is determined by the total number of logic blocks × the area per logic tile, there is clearly an area trade-off.

> 查找表的输入个数影响FPGA的面积和延迟，一般是4或6个输入。


### Routing Part

![routing-global](/assets/images/2024-02-02/routing-global.png)

> The island style is adopted by most FPGAs in recent years, and there are routing channels in the vertical and horizontal directions among logic blocks. Connections between logic blocks and routing blocks are generally a two-point connection or a four-point connection.

> 岛式风格的FPGA的routing架构见上图。

![routing-detail](/assets/images/2024-02-02/routing-detail.png)

> In the detailed routing architecture, the switch arrangement between logic blocks and wire channels, and the length of the wire segment are determined. W denotes the number of tracks per channel, and there are several wire segment lengths. There are two types of connection blocks (CBs), one for the input and the other for the output. The flexibility of the input CB is defined as F<sub>cin</sub>, and as F<sub>cout</sub> for the output. A switch block (SB) exists at the intersection of the routing channel in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. The switch block flexibility is defined by Fs. In this example, W = 4, F<sub>cin</sub> = 2/4 = 0.5, and F<sub>cout</sub> = 1/4 = 0.25. Also, an SB has inputs from three directions with respect to the one output, Fs = 3.

### Switch Block

![switch-type](/assets/images/2024-02-02/switch-type.png)

> The switch block (SB) is located at the intersection of the wiring channels in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, and wiring routes are determined by the programmable switches. There are three types of typical topologies: disjoint
type, universal type, and Wilton type.

* **Disjoint type** Disjoint-type SB connects wiring tracks of the same number in four directions with Fs = 3. When W = 4, the left track L0 is connected to T0, R0, B0, and so is the same as W = 5. Since the connection is realized by six switch sets, the total number of switches is 6W. The disjoint-type SB requires a small number of switches, but since it only can connect tracks of the same index value, the flexibility is low.

* **Universal type** Like the disjoint-type SB, it consists of 6W switches. On the other hand, two pairs of wire tracks can be connected in the SB. When W = 4, wire tracks 0, 3 and 1, 2 are paired. If there is no pair such as wiring track 4 when W = 5, it has the same connection configuration as the disjoint-type SB. The total number of wiring tracks can be reduced with the universal type when compared with disjoint-type SB. However, the universal-type SB assumes only the single line and does not correspond to other wire lengths.

* **Wilton type** In the disjoint and the universal-type SBs, only the wiring tracks of the same number or two pairs of wiring tracks which are paired are connected. On the other hand, in the Wilton-type SB, it is possible to connect wiring tracks of different values with 6W switches. When W = 4, the wire track L0 in the left direction is connected to the wire track T0 in the upward direction and the wire track B3 and R0 in the downward direction and the right direction. Here, at least one wire track is connected to the wiring track (W − 1) which is the longest distance. As a result, when routing is performed across several SBs, the routing flexibility is higher than that of other topologies. In addition, it is known that the Wilton type forms a closed circuit by several switch blocks by passing through a clockwise or counterclockwise path. By using this feature, it was shown that the efficiency of manufacturing test of FPGAs can be improved. 

> switch有3种连线方式：相同序号相连，结对相连，一个最长连接。


### Connection Block

![connection-block](/assets/images/2024-02-02/connection-block.png)

> The connection block (CB) has a role of connecting the input and output of the routing channel and the logic block, which is also composed of programmable switches. Like a local connection block, CB has a trade-off between the number of switches and the flexibility of routing. Particularly, since the routing channel width is very large, if it is simply composed of a full crossbar, the area becomes a problem. For this reason, sparse crossbars are used in CB. Wire tracks consist of unidirectional wires, 14 forward wires (F0–F13), and 14 reverse wires (B0–B13). These 28 wire tracks and 6 LB inputs (In0–In5) are connected by the CB. Since each LB input is connected to 14 wiring tracks, Fcin = 14/28 = 0.5.

> 连接块包含和switch块相连的双向channel，输入channel与之相交。


### I/O Block

> An I/O element consists of an I/O dedicated module which interfaces between the I/O pad and an LB. This module is called I/O block (input/output block, IOB), and the IOBs are arranged along the periphery of the chip. The I/O pins of an FPGA have various roles such as power supply, clock, user I/O. An I/O block is placed between an LB and the I/O, such as I/O buffer, output driver, polarity designation, high impedance control and exchanges input/output signals. There are FFs in an IOB so that I/O signals can be latched.
