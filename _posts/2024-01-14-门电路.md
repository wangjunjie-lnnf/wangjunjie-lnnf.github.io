# 门电路

> The term gate is used to describe a digital circuit that implements the most basic functions possible within the binary system. When discussing the operation of a logic gate, we ignore the details of how the 1s and 0s are represented with voltages and manipulated using transistors. We instead treat the inputs and output as simply ideal 1s and 0s. This allows us to design more complex logic circuits without going into the details of the underlying physical hardware

## 描述逻辑电路的方式

### 逻辑符号

> A logic symbol is a graphical representation of the circuit that can be used in a schematic to show how circuits in a system interface with one another. For the set of basic logic gates, there are uniquely shaped symbols that graphically indicate their functionality. For more complex logic circuits that are implemented with multiple basic gates, a simple rectangular symbol is used. Inputs of the logic circuit are typically shown on the left of the symbol, and outputs are on the right. 

> 逻辑符号表示一个电路的语义和接口，基础门电路有固定的逻辑符号，复杂的电路用方块表示内部细节，输入在左输出在右。

### 真值表

> We formally define the functionality of a logic circuit using a truth table. In a truth table, each and every possible input combination is listed, and the corresponding output of the logic circuit is given. If a logic circuit has n inputs, then it will have 2<sup>n</sup> possible input codes. The binary codes are listed in ascending order within the truth table mimicking a binary count starting at 0. By always listing the input codes in this way, we can assign a row number to each input that is the decimal equivalent of the binary input code. Row numbers can be used to simplify the notation for describing the functionality of larger circuits.

> 真值表会依序列出每个输入变量的值的组合及其相应的输出值

### 逻辑函数

![logic-function](/assets/images/2024-01-14/logic-function.png)

> A logic expression (also called a logic function) is an equation that provides the functionality of each output in the circuit as a function of the inputs. The logic function describes the operations that are necessary to produce the outputs listed in the truth table. A logic function is used to describe a single output that can take on only the values 1 and 0. If a circuit contains multiple outputs, then a logic function is needed for each output. 

> 逻辑函数是布尔表达式，每个输出变量都需要一个布尔表达式。

### 波形图

> A logic waveform is a graphical depiction of the relationship of the output to the inputs with respect to time. This is often a useful description of behavior since it mimics the format that is typically observed when measuring a real digital circuit using test equipment such as an oscilloscope. In the waveform, each signal can only take on a value of 1 or 0. It is useful to write the logic values of the signal at each transition in the waveform for readability. 

> 波形图描述了随着时间变化输入变量对输出变量的影响，类似于使用示波器观察真实电路。

## 基础门电路

> 每个门电路都有两个基础功能：信号放大和逻辑函数

### Buffer

> buffer的输出跟输入保持一致，看起来没有啥用，但是它还有一个基础功能：信号放大。

### Inverter

> 通常使用小圆圈表示反转。Out = $\overline{\text{In}}$

### AND

### NAND

### OR

### NOR

### XOR
