# 门电路

> The term gate is used to describe a digital circuit that implements the most basic functions possible within the binary system. When discussing the operation of a logic gate, we ignore the details of how the 1s and 0s are represented with voltages and manipulated using transistors. We instead treat the inputs and output as simply ideal 1s and 0s. This allows us to design more complex logic circuits without going into the details of the underlying physical hardware

## 描述逻辑电路的方式

### 逻辑符号

![logic-symbol](/assets/images/2024-01-14/logic-symbol.png)

> A logic symbol is a graphical representation of the circuit that can be used in a schematic to show how circuits in a system interface with one another. For the set of basic logic gates, there are uniquely shaped symbols that graphically indicate their functionality. For more complex logic circuits that are implemented with multiple basic gates, a simple rectangular symbol is used. Inputs of the logic circuit are typically shown on the left of the symbol, and outputs are on the right.

### 真值表

![truth-table](/assets/images/2024-01-14/truth-table.png)

> We formally define the functionality of a logic circuit using a truth table. In a truth table, each and every possible input combination is listed, and the corresponding output of the logic circuit is given. If a logic circuit has n inputs, then it will have 2<sup>n</sup> possible input codes. The binary codes are listed in ascending order within the truth table mimicking a binary count starting at 0. By always listing the input codes in this way, we can assign a row number to each input that is the decimal equivalent of the binary input code. Row numbers can be used to simplify the notation for describing the functionality of larger circuits.

> 真值表会依序列出每个输入变量的值的组合及其相应的输出值

### 逻辑函数

![logic-function](/assets/images/2024-01-14/logic-function.png)

> A logic expression (also called a logic function) is an equation that provides the functionality of each output in the circuit as a function of the inputs. The logic function describes the operations that are necessary to produce the outputs listed in the truth table. A logic function is used to describe a single output that can take on only the values 1 and 0. If a circuit contains multiple outputs, then a logic function is needed for each output. 

> 逻辑函数是布尔表达式，每个输出变量都需要一个布尔表达式。

### 波形图

> A logic waveform is a graphical depiction of the relationship of the output to the inputs with respect to time. This is often a useful description of behavior since it mimics the format that is typically observed when measuring a real digital circuit using test equipment such as an oscilloscope. In the waveform, each signal can only take on a value of 1 or 0. It is useful to write the logic values of the signal at each transition in the waveform for readability. 

> 波形图描述了随着时间变化输入变量对输出变量的影响，类似于使用示波器观察真实电路。

## 门电路的物理特性

### Logic Levels

![logic-level](/assets/images/2024-01-14/logic-level.png)

> The mapping of a continuous variable onto a discrete binary variable is done by defining logic levels. The first gate is called the driver and the second gate is called the receiver. The output of the driver is connected to the input of the receiver. The driver produces a LOW(0) output in the range of 0 to V<sub>OL</sub> or a HIGH(1) output in the range of V<sub>OH</sub> to V<sub>DD</sub>. If the receiver gets an input in the range of 0 to V<sub>IL</sub>, it will consider the input to be LOW. If the receiver gets an input in the range of V<sub>IH</sub> to V<sub>DD</sub>., it will consider the input to be HIGH. If, for some reason such as noise or faulty components, the receiver’s input should fall in the forbidden zone between V<sub>IL</sub> and V<sub>IH</sub>, the behavior of the gate is unpredictable. V<sub>OH</sub>, V<sub>OL</sub>, V<sub>IH</sub>, and V<sub>IL</sub> are called the output and input high and low logic levels.

> 低电压表示0，高电压表示1，为了避免误差，中间空出一段缓冲地带。


### Noise Margins

> If the output of the driver is to be correctly interpreted at the input of the receiver, we must choose V<sub>OL</sub> < V<sub>IH</sub> and V<sub>OH</sub> > V<sub>IH</sub>. Thus, even if the output of the driver is contaminated by some noise, the input of the receiver will still detect the correct logic level. The noise margin(NM) is the amount of noise that could be added to a worst-case output such that the signal can still be interpreted as a valid input. 

> 输出域比输入域更窄以抵消轻微的波动。


### Power Supplies

> All digital circuits require a power supply voltage and a ground. For simplicity, we will focus on digital circuits that only require a single power supply voltage and ground. The power supply voltage is commonly given the abbreviations of either V<sub>CC</sub> or V<sub>DD</sub>. The “CC” or “DD” have to do with how the terminals of the transistors inside of the digital circuit are connected (i.e., “collector to collector” or “drain to drain”). Digital circuits will specify the required power supply voltage. Ground is considered an ideal 0 v. Digital circuits will also specify the maximum amount of DC current that can flow through the V<sub>CC</sub>(I<sub>CC</sub>) and GND(I<sub>GND</sub>) pins before damaging the part.

> 所有的电子电路都需要电源电压和接地电压。

> There are two components of a power supply current. The first is the current that is required for the functional operation of the device. This is called the quiescent current (I<sub>q</sub>). The second component of the power supply current is the output current (I<sub>O</sub>). Any current that flows out of a digital circuit must also flow into it. When a transmitting circuit sources current to a load on its output pin, it must bring in that same amount of current on another pin. This is accomplished using the power supply pin (V<sub>CC</sub>). Conversely, when a transmitting circuit sinks current from a load on its input pin, an equal amount of current must exit the circuit on a different pin. This is accomplished using the GND pin. This means that the amount of current flowing through the V<sub>CC</sub> and GND pins will vary depending on the logic states that are being driven on the outputs. Since a digital circuit may contain numerous output pins, the maximum amount of current flowing through the V<sub>CC</sub> and GND pins can scale quickly and care must be taken not to damage the device.
