# 时序电路的时序

## 时序规则

> Recall that a flip-flop copies the input D to the output Q on the rising edge of the clock. This process is called sampling D on the clock edge. If D is stable at either 0 or 1 when the clock rises, this behavior is clearly defined. But what happens if D is changing at the same time the clock rises?

> `flip-flop`是边缘触发的，在`CLK`的上升沿对输入`D`进行采样，以此确定输出`Q`，这就要求在采样时输入`D`要保持稳定。

> This problem is similar to that faced by a camera when snapping a picture. Imagine photographing a frog jumping from a lily pad into the lake. If you take the picture before the jump, you will see a frog on a lily pad. If you take the picture after the jump, you will see ripples in the water. But if you take it just as the frog jumps, you may see a blurred image of the frog stretching from the lily pad into the water. A camera is characterized by its aperture time, during which the object must remain still for a sharp image to be captured. Similarly, a sequential element has an aperture time around the clock edge, during which the input must be stable for the flip-flop to produce a well-defined output.

> 想象要拍一张青蛙从荷叶上跳入水中的照片，快门按早了还没开始跳，按晚了只能看到波纹了，如果正好在跳的那一刻按快门可能拍到模糊的照片。照相机有个参数叫光圈时间，在此时间内被拍摄物要保持不动才能拍出清楚的照片。同理，时序电路要求在时钟边缘输入信号是稳定的。

> The aperture of a sequential element is defined by a setup time and a hold time, before and after the clock edge, respectively. Just as the static discipline limited us to using logic levels outside the forbidden zone, the dynamic discipline limits us to using signals that change outside the aperture time. By taking advantage of the dynamic discipline, we can think of time in discrete units called clock cycles, just as we think of signal levels as discrete 1’s and 0’s. A signal may glitch and oscillate wildly for some bounded amount of time. Under the dynamic discipline, we are concerned only about its final value at the end of the clock cycle, after it has settled to a stable value. Hence, we can simply write A[n], the value of signal A at the end of the nth clock cycle, where n is an integer, rather than A(t), the value of A at some instant t, where t is any real number.

> 现实的信号是模拟信号，例如电压从0变成1不是一蹴而就的，有一个变化的过程，我们关心的是采样时的值，并不关心变化的过程。为了便于处理，将物理的时间抽象成逻辑上的周期即为时钟周期，我们描述一个信号在某个时刻的值使用时钟周期而不是物理时间。

> The clock period has to be long enough for all signals to settle. This sets a limit on the speed of the system. 

> 时钟周期需要足够长以确保所有的信号到达确定状态，时钟周期又应该尽量短以提高系统速度。

> When the clock rises, the output (or outputs) may start to change after the clock-to-Q contamination delay, t<sub>ccq</sub>, and must definitely settle to the final value within the clock-to-Q propagation delay, t<sub>pcq</sub>. These represent the fastest and slowest delays through the circuit, respectively. For the circuit to sample its input correctly, the input (or inputs) must have stabilized at least some setup time, t<sub>setup</sub>, before the rising edge of the clock and must remain stable for at least some hold time, t<sub>hold</sub>, after the rising edge of the clock. The sum of the setup and hold times is called the aperture time of the circuit, because it is the total time for which the input must remain stable.

> t<sub>ccq</sub>表示从时钟变化到output开始变化的时间；t<sub>pcq</sub>表示从时钟变化到output变为完成的时间；t<sub>setup</sub>和t<sub>hold</sub>表示时钟变化前后要输入信号要保持稳定的时间。

> The dynamic discipline states that the inputs of a synchronous sequential circuit must be stable during the setup and hold aperture time around the clock edge. By imposing this requirement, we guarantee that the flip-flops sample signals while they are not changing. Because we are concerned only about the final values of the inputs at the time they are sampled, we can treat signals as discrete in time as well as in logic levels.

> 为了采样时得到的信号是稳定的，要求输入信号在t<sub>setup</sub>和t<sub>hold</sub>内保持稳定。物理上时间和电压都是连续变化的，逻辑上我们把时间分割成时钟周期，把电压划分为低压0和高压1。


## 时序约束

> The clock period or cycle time, Tc, is the time between rising edges of a repetitive clock signal. Its reciprocal, fc = 1/Tc, is the clock frequency. All else being the same, increasing the clock frequency increases the work that a digital system can accomplish per unit time. Frequency is measured in units of Hertz (Hz), or cycles per second: 1 megahertz (MHz) = 106 Hz, and 1 gigahertz (GHz) = 109 Hz.

> 一个时钟周期是指从一个上升沿到下一个上升沿的时间。时钟频率是指1秒内的时钟周期数，增加时钟频率可以提供系统处理速度。

> Figure(a) illustrates a generic path in a synchronous sequential circuit whose clock period we wish to calculate. On the rising edge of the clock, register R1 produces output (or outputs) Q1. These signals enter a block of combinational logic, producing D2, the input (or inputs) to register R2. The timing diagram in Figure(b) shows that each output signal may start to change a contamination delay after its input changes and settles to the final value within a propagation delay after its input settles. The gray arrows represent the contamination delay through R1 and the combinational logic, and the blue arrows represent the propagation delay through R1 and the combinational logic. We analyze the timing constraints with respect to the setup and hold time of the second register, R2.

### setup时间约束

![setup-time](/assets/images/2024-01-21/setup-time.png)

> Tc表示一个时钟周期，t<sub>pcd</sub>表示clock-to-Q传播延迟，t<sub>setup</sub>表示R2的setup时间，t<sub>pd</sub>表示组合电路的传播延迟。其中t<sub>pcd</sub>和t<sub>setup</sub>是flip-flop制造时确定的。不等式 t<sub>pd</sub> <= Tc - (t<sub>pcd</sub> + t<sub>setup</sub>) 表明了 t<sub>pd</sub> 和 Tc的关系：如果组合电路延迟很高，必须增加时钟周期，否则会导致R2的t<sub>setup</sub>时长过短，进而导致R2的下游R3在采样时得到错误的值。

> 为了增加时钟频率需要降低Tc，这就要求flip-flop之间的组合电路延迟尽量低。如果组合电路比较复杂，可以拆分成多个简单的组合电路，每两个组合电路之间新增flip-flop存储中间状态。


### hold时间约束

![hold-time](/assets/images/2024-01-21/hold-time.png)

> t<sub>cd</sub>表示组合电路的延迟，t<sub>ccq</sub>和t<sub>hold</sub>是flip-flop制造时确定的。不等式 t<sub>cd</sub> >= t<sub>hold</sub> - t<sub>ccq</sub> 表明了 t<sub>cd</sub> 的最小值：如果t<sub>cd</sub>过小会导致R2在t<sub>hold</sub>内再次开始变化，进而导致R2的下游R3在采样时得到错误的值。

> 有一种特殊情况是两个flip-flop之间没有组合电路，例如`d-flip-flop`中的两个flip-flop就是直接相连的，此时 t<sub>cd</sub> = 0，然后不等式变成了 t<sub>hold</sub> <= t<sub>ccq</sub>，也即是说只要flip-flop在制造时t<sub>hold</sub>不超过其t<sub>ccq</sub>即可。


### 总结

> Sequential circuits have setup and hold time constraints that dictate the maximum and minimum delays of the combinational logic between flip-flops. Modern flip-flops are usually designed so that the minimum delay through the combinational logic can be 0—that is, flip-flops can be placed back-to-back. The maximum delay constraint limits the number of consecutive gates on the critical path of a high-speed circuit because a high clock frequency means a short clock period.
