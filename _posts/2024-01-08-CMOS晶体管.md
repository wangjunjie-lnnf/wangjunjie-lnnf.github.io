# CMOS晶体管

## CMOS晶体管

> Transistors are electrically controlled switches that turn ON or OFF when a voltage or current is applied to a control terminal. The main type of transistors is metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs or MOS transistors, pronounced “mossfets” or “M-O-S”, respectively).

### 半导体

> By itself, silicon is a poor conductor because all the electrons are tied up in covalent bonds as shown in Figure(a). However, it becomes a better conductor when small amounts of impurities, called dopant atoms, are carefully added. If a group V dopant such as arsenic (As) is added, the dopant atoms have an extra electron that is not involved in the bonds. That electron can easily move about the lattice, leaving an ionized dopant atom (As+) behind, as shown in Figure(b). The electron carries a negative charge, so we call arsenic an n-type dopant. On the other hand, if a group III dopant such as boron (B) is added, the dopant atoms are missing an electron, as shown in Figure(c). This missing electron is called a hole. An electron from a neighboring silicon atom may move over to fill the missing bond, forming an ionized dopant atom (B−) and leaving a hole at the neighboring silicon atom. In a similar fashion, the hole can migrate around the lattice. The hole is a lack of negative charge, so it acts like a positively charged particle. Hence, we call boron a p-type dopant. Because the conductivity of silicon changes over many orders of magnitude depending on the concentration of dopants, silicon is called a semiconductor.

> 硅是一种弱导体，但是在掺入杂质后会增加导电性。例如：在加入砷之后，砷原子会空出一个正电子构成`n-type`；在加入硼之后硼原子会空出一个负电子构成`p-type`。由于硅的导电性随着杂质的浓度增加而增强，所以硅叫半导体。


### 二极管

![diode](/assets/images/2024-01-08/diode.png)

> The junction between p-type and n-type silicon is called a diode. The p-type region is called the anode and the n-type region is called the cathode. When the voltage on the anode rises above the voltage on the cathode, the diode is forward biased, and current flows through the diode from the anode to the cathode. But when the anode voltage is lower than the voltage on the cathode, the diode is reverse biased, and no current flows. The diode symbol intuitively shows that current only flows in one direction.

> `p-type`和`n-type`的晶体管组合之后构成二极管，`p-type`是阳极，`n-type`是阴极。当阳极电压超过阴极时，电流从阳极流向阴极，当阳极电压低于阴极时，没有电子流动。参考上节两种结构就很容易理解了。


### 电容

![capacitor](/assets/images/2024-01-08/capacitor.png)

> A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. When a voltage V is applied to one of the conductors, the conductor accumulates electric charge Q and the other conductor accumulates the opposite charge −Q.

> 两个相互靠近的导体，中间夹一层不导电的绝缘介质，这就构成了电容器。当电容器的两个极板之间加上电压时，电容器就会储存电荷。


### nMOS和pMOS晶体管

> A MOSFET is a sandwich of several layers of conducting and insulating materials. MOSFETs are built on thin, flat wafers of silicon of about 15 to 30cm in diameter. The manufacturing process begins with a bare wafer. The process involves a sequence of steps in which dopants are implanted into the silicon, thin films of silicon dioxide and silicon are grown, and metal is deposited. Between each step, the wafer is patterned so that the materials appear only where they are desired. Because transistors are a fraction of a micron1 in length and the entire wafer is processed at once, it is inexpensive to manufacture billions of transistors at a time. Once processing is complete, the wafer is cut into rectangles called chips or dice that contain thousands, millions, or even billions of transistors. The chip is tested, then placed in a plastic or ceramic package with metal pins to connect it to a circuit board.

> 金属氧化物半导体是一种由多层导体和绝缘体构成的材料。制造过程基于硅薄片，然后掺入杂质.

![transistor](/assets/images/2024-01-08/transistor.png)

> The MOSFET sandwich consists of a conducting layer called the gate on top of an insulating layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on top of the silicon wafer, called the substrate. Historically, the gate was constructed from metal, hence the name metal-oxide-semiconductor. Modern manufacturing processes use polycrystalline silicon for the gate because it does not melt during subsequent high-temperature processing steps. The metal-oxide-semiconductor sandwich forms a capacitor, in which a thin layer of insulating oxide called a dielectric separates the metal and semiconductor plates.

> gate是材质为多晶硅的导体，二氧化硅是绝缘体，`p-type`的硅也是导体，三者合在一起构成了电容。

> There are two flavors of MOSFETs: nMOS and pMOS. The n-type transistors, called nMOS, have regions of n-type dopants adjacent to the gate called the source and the drain and are built on a p-type semiconductor substrate. The pMOS transistors are just the opposite, consisting of p-type source and drain regions in an n-type substrate.

> 由两种类型的晶体管：nMOS和pMOS，nMOS是`n-type`的source和drain加上`p-type`的衬底，pMOS与其相反。

> A MOSFET behaves as a voltage-controlled switch in which the gate voltage creates an electric field that turns ON or OFF a connection between the source and drain. 

> 通过控制gate上的电压可以形成电子场从而连通source和drain。

![nMOS](/assets/images/2024-01-08/nMOS.png)

> The substrate of an nMOS transistor is normally tied to GND, the lowest voltage in the system. First, consider the situation when the gate is also at 0V, as shown in Figure(a). The diodes between the source or drain and the substrate are reverse biased because the source or drain voltage is nonnegative. Hence, there is no path for current to flow between the source and drain, so the transistor is OFF. Now, consider when the gate is raised to VDD, as shown in Figure(b). When a positive voltage is applied to the top plate of a capacitor, it establishes an electric field that attracts positive charge on the top plate and negative charge to the bottom plate. If the voltage is sufficiently large, so much negative charge is attracted to the underside of the gate that the region inverts from p-type to effectively become n-type. This inverted region is called the channel. Now the transistor has a continuous path from the n-type source through the n-type channel to the n-type drain, so electrons can flow from source to drain. The transistor is ON. The gate voltage required to turn on a transistor is called the threshold voltage, Vt, and is typically 0.3 to 0.7V.

> nMOS晶体管的衬底是接地的，当gate的电压是0V时，p-type的衬底和n-type的source/drain构成二极管，所以source和drain是无法连通的。当gate的电压增加时，gate和衬底构成的电容开始充电，如果电压足够大，在电子场效应下，source和drain之间p-type类型的衬底转换为n-type，从而使source和drain连通。

> pMOS与nMOS相反，n-type的衬底电压为VDD，当gate的电压也是VDD时，p-type的source/drain和n-type的衬底构成二极管，所以source和drain是无法连通的。当gate的电压变成0时，gate和衬底构成的电容开始反向充电，在电子场效应下，source和drain之间n-type类型的衬底转换为p-type，从而使source和drain连通。

> Unfortunately, MOSFETs are not perfect switches. In particular, nMOS transistors pass 0’s well but pass 1’s poorly. Specifically, when the gate of an nMOS transistor is at VDD, the source will only swing between 0 and VDD − Vt when its drain ranges from 0 to VDD. Similarly, pMOS transistors pass 1’s well but 0’s poorly. However, we will see that it is possible to build logic gates that use transistors only in their good mode.

> nMOS的source电压范围是[0, VDD − Vt]，如果太大会干扰电场，所以适合表示0；pMOS的source电压范围是[VDD - Vt, VDD]，如果太小会干扰电场，所以适合表示1。

> nMOS transistors need a p-type substrate, and pMOS transistors need an n-type substrate. To build both flavors of transistors on the same chip, manufacturing processes typically start with a p-type wafer, then implant n-type regions called wells where the pMOS transistors should go. These processes that provide both flavors of transistors are called Complementary MOS or CMOS. CMOS processes are used to build the vast majority of all transistors fabricated today.

> CMOS是指nMOS和pMOS共存。

> CMOS提供两种电控开关，nMOS晶体管低电压时开高电压时关，pMOS相反。


## 基于CMOS实现门电路

> The term gate is used to describe a digital circuit that implements the most basic functions possible within the binary system. When discussing the operation of a logic gate, we ignore the details of how the 1s and 0s are represented with voltages and manipulated using transistors. We instead treat the inputs and output as simply ideal 1s and 0s. This allows us to design more complex logic circuits without going into the details of the underlying physical hardware.  

> `门`用于描述最基础的数字电路。

### NOT

![CMOS-NOT](/assets/images/2024-01-08/CMOS-NOT.png)

> The triangle indicates GND, and the flat bar indicates VDD. The nMOS transistor, N1, is connected between GND and the Y output. The pMOS transistor, P1, is connected between VDD and the Y output. Both transistor gates are controlled by the input, A. If A = 0, N1 is OFF and P1 is ON. Hence, Y is connected to VDD but not to GND, and is pulled up to a logic 1. P1 passes a good 1. If A = 1, N1 is ON and P1 is OFF, and Y is pulled down to a logic 0. N1 passes a good 0.

> 当A=0时，N1关闭P1打开，从而Y与VDD连接输出表示1的高电压；当A=1时，N1打开P1关闭，从而Y与GND连接输出表示0的低电压。根据真值表，这就是not门。


### NAND

![CMOS-NAND](/assets/images/2024-01-08/CMOS-NAND.png)

> The nMOS transistors N1 and N2 are connected in series; both nMOS transistors must be ON to pull the output down to GND. The pMOS transistors P1 and P2 are in parallel; only one pMOS transistor need be ON to pull the output up to VDD.

> 只有当A和B都是1时，P1和P2都关闭，N1和N2都打开，此时Y与GND连接输出表示0的低电压；其他3种情况下N1和N2不会同时打开，P1和P2至少打开一个，从而Y与VDD连接输出表示1的高电压。


### NOR

![CMOS-NOR](/assets/images/2024-01-08/CMOS-NOR.png)

> The two pMOS transistors are connected in series; both pMOS transistors must be ON to pull the output uo to VDD. The two nMOS transistors are in parallel; only one nMOS transistor need be ON to pull the output down to GND.

> 只有当A和B都是0时，pMOs都打开，nMos都关闭，此时Y与VDD连接输出表示1的高电压；其他3种情况下pMOS不会同时打开，nMOS至少打开一个，从而Y与GND连接输出表示0的低电压。

### 通用反转电路

![CMOS-general](/assets/images/2024-01-08/CMOS-general.png)

> nMOS transistors are good at passing 0’s, so a pull-down network of nMOS transistors is placed between the output and GND to pull the output down to 0. pMOS transistors are good at passing 1’s, so a pull-up network of pMOS transistors is placed between the output and VDD to pull the output up to 1. The networks may consist of transistors in series or in parallel. When transistors are in parallel, the network is ON if either transistor is ON. When transistors are in series, the network is ON only if both transistors are ON. 

> p-type晶体管在打开时会产生高电压，所以放在VDD和output之间；n-type晶体管在打开时会产生低电压，所以放在GND和output之间。

> If both the pull-up and pull-down networks were ON simultaneously, a short circuit would exist between VDD and GND. The output of the gate might be in the forbidden zone and the transistors would consume large amounts of power, possibly enough to burn out. On the other hand, if both the pull-up and pull-down networks were OFF simultaneously, the output would be connected to neither VDD nor GND. We say that the output floats. Its value is again undefined.

> 如果两个网络同时打开会造成短路，如果都关闭会导致output产生不确定的值。

> In a properly functioning logic gate, one of the networks should be ON and the other OFF at any given time, so that the output is pulled HIGH or LOW but not shorted or floating. We can guarantee this by using the rule of conduction complements. When nMOS transistors are in series, the pMOS transistors must be in parallel. When nMOS transistors are in parallel, the pMOS transistors must be in series.

> 为了避免短路和不确定性，两个网络必须是一个串联和一个并联。

## 传输门

![CMOS-transmission-gate](/assets/images/2024-01-08/CMOS-transmission-gate.png)

> Recall that nMOS transistors are good at passing 0 and pMOS transistors are good at passing 1, so the parallel combination of the two passes both values well. The two sides of the switch are called A and B because a switch is bidirectional and has no preferred input or output side. The control signals are called enables, EN. When EN = 0, both transistors are OFF. Hence, the transmission gate is OFF or disabled, so A and B are not connected. When EN = 1, the transmission gate is ON or enabled, and any logic value can flow between A and B.

> 上面的nMOS和下面的pMOS并联，EN连接到gate以控制开关，A和B分别连接两个晶体管的source和drain，这样当EN=1时，A和B之间可以同时传输0和1。当传输表示0的低电压时，pMOS的电场会收到干扰，nMOS会顺畅；当传输表示1的高电压时，nMos的电场会收到干扰，pMOS会顺畅。


## NOR电路优化

> An N-input CMOS NOR gate uses N nMOS transistors in parallel and N pMOS transistors in series. Transistors in series are slower than transistors in parallel, just as resistors in series have more resistance than resistors in parallel. Moreover, `pMOS transistors are slower than nMOS transistors because holes cannot move around the silicon lattice as fast as electrons`. Therefore, the parallel nMOS transistors are fast and the series pMOS transistors are slow, especially when many are in series.

> pMOS比nMOS慢，实现NOR时需要多个pMOS串联，导致pMOS网络更慢。

![pseudo-nMOS](/assets/images/2024-01-08/pseudo-nMOS.png)

> Pseudo-nMOS logic replaces the slow stack of pMOS transistors with a single weak pMOS transistor that is always ON. This pMOS transistor is often called a weak pull-up. The physical dimensions of the pMOS transistor are selected so that the pMOS transistor will pull the output Y HIGH weakly—that is, only if none of the nMOS transistors are ON. But if any nMOS transistor is ON, it overpowers the weak pull-up and pulls Y down close enough to GND to produce a logic 0.

> 优化方法是把串联的pMOS替换为一个保持打开的弱pMOS。
