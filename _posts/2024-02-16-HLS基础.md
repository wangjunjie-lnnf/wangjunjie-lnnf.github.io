# HLS基础

> The promise of high-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful one: the ability to generate production quality register transfer level (RTL) implementations from high-level specifications. In other words, HLS automates an otherwise manual process, eliminating the source of many design errors and accelerating a very long and iterative part of the development cycle.

HLS的过程类似普通的C/C++编译成汇编语言的过程，只是对此处的C/C++有一些特殊要求，编译的结果也不是汇编语言，而是更底层的硬件描述语言Verilog/VHDL


## Data Types

> The need for bit-accuracy becomes especially obvious now that designers are building hardware directly from C++, whose native types only come in widths of 1, 8, 16, 32, etc, bits. To date there are two industry standard bit accurate data types, the `SystemC` and `Mentor Graphics Algorithmic C` data types. Although SystemC was developed first, the implementation of its bit-accurate data types suffers from a number of issues, the biggest being long execution runtimes. Because of this, customer demand drove Mentor to develop their own bit-accurate types, which have now become the most widely used data types in high-level synthesis. The Algorithmic C data types not only simulate much faster than the SystemC types, but give better quality of results for synthesis over “home grown” bit accurate types. Algorithmic C data types are also consistent between C++ and RTL simulation. So whatever you build in C++ matches the true hardware behavior. 

C/C++原生的数据类型bit长度是特定的，高效的描述硬件行为需要bit精确的数据类型，主流的bit精确的数据类型包括`SystemC`和`Algorithmic C`，`Algorithmic C`仿真效率更高、综合结果更好。

整数数据类型: `ac_int<W, S>`，W表示宽度，S表示符号

```C++
// Algorithmic-C头文件
#include <ac_int.h>

// 3-bit的无符号数
ac_int<3, false> x;

// 5-bit的有符号数
ac_int<5, true> y;
```

定点数据类型: `ac_fixed<W, I, S>`，W表示总宽度，I表示整数宽度，S表示符号

```C++
// Algorithmic-C头文件
#include <ac_fixed.h>

// 总长7-bit且整数部分3-bit的无符号定点数
ac_fixed<7, 3, false> x;

// 总长7-bit且整数部分3-bit的有符号定点数
ac_fixed<7, 3, true> y;
```

---

`ac_int`和`ac_fixed`支持所有标准的C++算术和逻辑操作符

* **Bitwise Arithmetic Operators: *, +, -, /, &, |, ^, %** The `Algorithmic C` bitwise arithmetic operators are designed so that there is no loss of precision in the return value. Furthermore the mixture of signed and unsigned Algorithmic C data types is supported, and returns the expected signedness. The return type of an arithmetic operation automatically takes care of bit growth so that there is no loss of precision. This can be done automatically because the bit widths of the two operands are specified as template parameters when the `ac_int` variables are declared. 

算术操作不会导致精度丢失，支持有符号数和无符号数混合

```C++
ac_int<8,true> a,b; //8-bits signed

// Multiplying “a” times “b”, each with 8 bits of precision, requires 16 bits of precision:
(returns ac_int<16,true>)(a*c)

// Adding “a” plus “b” requires nine bits of precision:
(returns ac_int<9,true>)(a+b)
```

* **Bit Select Operator: []** Individual bits can be read or written from an `ac_int` or `ac_fixed` data type using the `[]` operator. The operator index selects the bit position. E.g. `x[1], x[3], x[7]`. The return value is an object of class `ac_int::bitref` and a built-in conversion function to ac_int and bool are provided. 

```C++
ac_int<11,true> x;

// 隐式转换为bool
bool is_neg; = x[10];

// 直接更新指定bit
x[8] = 1;
```

* **Shift Operators: <<, >>** 支持有符号数和无符号数

```C++
ac_int<4,false> x = -1;     // set all bits to 1's
ac_int<4,false> y = x >> 2; // y=3

// 有符号数右移填充符号位
ac_int<4,true> x = 0;
x[3] = 1                    // set x equal -8
ac_int<4,true> y = x >> 2;  // y=-2
```

---

The Algorithmic C data types provide a number of built-in methods.

```C++
ac_int<8,false> x = 100;

// slice read: 从索引2开始取3个bit
ac_int<3,false> y = x.slc<3>(2);

// 把y放到x索引2的位置
x.set_slc(2, y);


ac_fixed<8,3,false> x = 3.185;

// to_int()取整数部分
ac_int<8,false> y = x.to_int();

// ac_int转int
printf("%d\n", y.to_int());
```

## 编码规范

> Starting the HW design from an untimed behavioral description is like drawing a picture on a new canvas. The painter might have the idea of what to paint in his mind, but not know exactly how to accomplish it. In HLS, the question is how to generate the desired hardware from an untimed description that does not even have a clock or rest. This is one of the main benefits, but also drawback of HLS. It allows to generate functionally equivalent circuits, but with very different underlining structures and hence, different area, performance and power trade-offs from the same description. This is done by setting different HLS synthesis options. The designer has to fully understand all of these synthesis options and how they interact with each other.

根据无时序的C/C++生成硬件电路好比是在白纸上画画，心里清楚要画什么却无从下手。HLS提供了很多综合选项，只有理解了这些选项对生成的电路的影响，才能更好的表达目标电路。

> HLS vendors provide an arsenal of optimizations that you can use. This should enable you to generate the desired hardware circuit. We call these options synthesis knobs and classify them into three different groups:

* **Global Synthesis Options (𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑏<sub>𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑠</sub>):** These are HLS options that are applied to the entire behavioral description to be synthesized. These include how to encode the FSM, synthesis frequency and synthesis mode.

* **Local Synthesis Directives (𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑏<sub>𝑝𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑚𝑎</sub>):** These synthesis directives specify how to synthesize individual operations in the behavioral description. Vendors use pragmas (comments) for these. They allow to e.g., control how to synthesize individual arrays, functions and memories.

* **Functional Unit Constraint (𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑏<sub>𝐹𝑈𝑠</sub>):** This knob allows the HLS user to control how many FUs the final circuit should have. These include adders, multipliers and dividers of different bitwidths.

HLS编译器提供了很多选项，分为三类：全局参数；局部指令；FU约束

> It should be noted that every HLS tool has its own set of default options. This implies that the same behavioral description will lead to a very different circuit when synthesized using a different HLS tool. Some tools by default fully parallelize the description, while other tools do not perform any optimization. It is therefore important to understand how as a HLS user you can generate the smallest possible hardware circuit that meets your performance and power constraints.

选项是编译器特定的，没有统一规范


### HLS Synthesis Knobs     

> **Global Synthesis Options (𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑏<sub>𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑠</sub>)** are options normally specified in a synthesis script and apply to the entire behavioral description to be synthesized. Some of these global options include how to synthesize loops, arrays, and functions, similar to the local synthesis directives, but are applicable to all of the loops, arrays, and functions in the behavioral description at the same time. With these global synthesis options, there is no way to specify different options for individual operations. For example, in the case of loops, all loops will be unrolled or not unrolled, but there is no way to unroll some of the loops, pipeline others and not unrolled some other loops in the description. Other options which are complementary to the local synthesis directives include the synthesis mode, clock constraint, data initiation interval (DII) for pipelined designs, encoding scheme for the finite state machine (FSM) controller (one-hot, regular encoding), etc. 

全局选项和局部指令部分互斥部分互补

> Most commercial HLS tools make extensive use of synthesis directives in the form of pragmas . These pragmas are inserted directly at the behavioral description in the form of comments. This has the main advantage of allowing a very fine controllability over the synthesis result and hence the final micro-architecture. **The main constructs in the behavioral description that have the highest impact on the final microarchitecture in HLS are loops, arrays and functions**. Loops can be completely unrolled or only partially unrolled. Loops can also be pipelined (folded) with different Data Initiation Intervals (DIIs). Arrays can be mapped to registers or memories of different types and ports and functions can be inlined or not.

```C++
/* pragma unroll= 0 | partial | all | fold */
for(x=0; x<8; x++)
```

对综合结果影响最大的结构是：循环、数组、函数。循环可以完全展开或部分展开；循环也可以通过管道实现并行；数组可以映射到寄存器或不同类型和端口的内存；函数可以选择是否inline。

> The number of Functional Units (FUs) allowed will affect the parallelism that can be extracted from the behavioral description. A well-known optimization technique called resource sharing can be used in order to reduce the area. In resource sharing, a single FU is reused among different computational operations in the behavioral description. For ASICs, the total design area can be significantly reduced as HLS can easily maximize the amount of resource sharing. In contrast, it was also shown that for FPGAs, resource sharing can actually lead to larger designs. This is mainly because the multiplexers required to share individual FUs have shown to require more logic resources than the actual FUs being shared. Commercial ASIC-style HLS tools typically perform resource-constraint HLS. This implies that the first stage in the HLS process is the resource allocation stage, which outputs a functional unit constraint file (FCNT) . This constraint file can in turn be edited to allow the designer to control the amount of resource sharing desired, which in turn leads to a micro-architecture of unique area vs. performance trade-off. This constraint set by the user delimits the maximum number of FUs that the HLS process can use, but does not imply that all of those resources will end up being used, as this constraint only specifies the upper bound of FUs that can be used. Depending on the other two knobs, less adders might be required, but under no circumstances, the HLS tool should use more FUs than specified by the user.

FU的数量影响可以并行的程度，常见的优化技术是资源共享，一个FU在不同的周期被不同的计算使用，对ASIC来说可以较小面积，对于FPGA来说由于共享而产生大量multiplexer从而导致反作用。

> Out of all three knobs, the local synthesis directives knob is the most powerful one as it basically decides upon the overall underlying microarchitecture. Commercial synthesizers also typically give priority to local synthesis directives when global synthesis options with opposing effects have been specified. It should be noted that these knobs are complementary, but also largely overlapping. E.g., a loop will not be fully unrolled if the number of functional units does not allow it. This shows how important it is to fully understand the consequences of limiting the number of FUs when specifying synthesis directives. 

局部指令对综合结果影响最大，当和全局参数产生冲突时，一般局部指令优先级跟高，局部指令最终也要受可用资源的约束。


### Synthesis Mode

![hls-mode](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-mode.png)

> The synthesis mode is a global synthesis option that enables the synthesis of applications with different characteristics. Most HLS tool vendors provide different synthesis engines under their hood. 

综合模式是一个全局参数，用于处理不同的应用类型。


> Most applications can be classified into one of these three families: 

* **Data intensive applications:** These are the most common applications used with HLS and include arithmetic intensive applications like DSP and video processing applications. They might also involve computationally intensive applications with little control structures like encryption algorithms, but that have large amounts of parallelism.

* **Control intensive applications:** These applications are also arithmetic intensive, but contain also many control structures like nested if-else conditions. In the past, these type of applications were not suitable for HLS, because the HLS tools were not able to extract enough parallelism from these applications to justify a dedicated hardware accelerator. Modern HLS tools make use of complex compiler optimizations like `different types of speculations` that allows to much better parallelize these applications.

* **Controllers or bus interfaces:** This category of applications include bus controllers that have very specific protocols which require specific timing that needs to be satisfied. Some HLS tools cannot synthesize these types of applications as regular C/C++ has no timing notion, while other HLS tools provide extensions in their C languages to deal with this.

应用一般分为：数据敏感应用；控制敏感应用；控制器或总线接口。数据敏感应用是HLS最常见的应用，包含大量并行计算和少量控制结构；控制敏感应用包含大量`if-else`结构；控制器或总线接口实现特定的协议。


> HLS vendors might include different HLS engines to deal with all of these applications

* **Automatic Synthesis Mode** Automatic synthesis mode is the traditional HLS synthesis mode. It is also what most people identify with HLS. The result of this process is an `FSM+Data path` where new inputs are read in state X and a new output is written in state Z.

* **Pipeline Synthesis Mode** For many multi-media applications throughput is very important. To achieve higher throughputs the hardware has to be fully pipelined. Pipelines function like a factory with multiple different stages allowing data to be fed into the pipeline every clock cycle, or every N clock cycles, based on the Data Initialization Interval (DII).

![hls-pipelined-cpu](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-pipelined-cpu.png)

> Pipelining is a well-known parallelization optimization that allows to parallelize the execution of any application. Figure above shows a typical 5-stage pipelined CPU architecture. The key that enables pipelining is the pipeline latches that allow to de-couple the different combinational portions of the circuit into unique pipeline stages.

管道就像工厂的流水线，是常用的优化方法，上图是一个典型的5阶段管道的cpu架构，管道的关键是解耦不同的部分到独立的阶段


> Thus, if throughput is important (e.g., in multimedia applications), then the HLS user might need to fully pipeline the circuit. This requires that the user specifies that the circuit should be pipelined and also the DII. DII basically specifies after how many clock cycles a new input is entering the pipeline. It thus, also determines the interval at which a new output is generated. E.g., if DII=1, then a new input enters the pipeline every clock cycle and when the pipeline is in steady operation mode, an output is generated every clock cycle too. 

管道有一个重要参数DII，DII指定两个输入间隔的时钟周期数量


* **Manual Synthesis Mode** Manual synthesis mode involves manually scheduling the behavioral description instead of relying on the HLS engine to do this. Some HLS tools allow to manually schedule the entire behavioral description, while other tools also allow to schedule a portion of the behavioral description, typically the IOs so that the data can be read and written into the hardware module following a particular protocol.

![hls-manual-mode](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-manual-mode.png)

上图中`$`表示时钟边界，用户可以以此自由控制时钟边界实现任何协议，适用于控制器或总线接口类应用


### Loop Synthesis

> One of the most widely used constructs in any high-level language are loops . These can be synthesized in many different ways. Thus, it is important to understand the effect of these loop synthesis options on the area and performance of the final circuit.

![hls-loop](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-loop.png)

> Figure above shows the different ways to synthesize loops in HLS and their trade-offs in terms of the area of the resultant circuit, the performance (in latency) and also the HLS synthesize time. As shown, fully unrolling the loop leads to the fastest of all the circuits, but also the largest, not unrolling the loop implies to sequentially execute each loop iteration like a CPU and hence, leading to a smaller circuit, but slower, while partially unrolling the loop with different unrolling factors lead to intermediate results.

循环完全展开延迟最小面积最大，循环顺序迭代延迟最高面积最小

有两种方式控制循环展开：全局参数和局部指令，局部指令更灵活，示例如下：

```C++
int data[16];

int ave8(int data_new){
    int sum=0, x;

    /* pragma unroll=all*/
    for(x=7; x>0; x--)
        data[x]=data[x-1];

    data[0]= data_new;

    /* pragma unroll=0|=4|=all*/
    for(x=0; x<8; x++)
        sum=sum+data[x];

    return(sum/8);
}
```

![hls-loop-example](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-loop-example.png)

上图展示了不同的展开方式生成的电路，完全不展开时需要一个加法和8个周期；完全展开时需要7个加法和1个周期。


> These results obviously also depend on how the array is synthesized as it assumes that all of the elements in the array can be accessed in parallel. This is not the case if the array is synthesized as a single port memory. It is therefore extremely important to understand how to synthesize arrays.

此例中循环的展开方式同时受数组的综合方式的影响


### Array Synthesis

![hls-array](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-array.png)

寄存器延迟更小但是需要更多晶体管

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
ROM     | Read-only memory
Logic   | Hard-coded logic for read-only array
RAM     | Memory, can have multiple ports
Register | Register bank with multiple ports
Expand  | Expand array to individual FFs

> Table above highlights the most common ways to synthesize arrays classified in whether they are read-only or not. Read-only arrays (arrays that have been initialized and are only read from) can be synthesized as ROMs or pure combinational logic. Read/Write arrays can be synthesized as RAM, registers or be expanded into individual FFs. Many of these synthesis options have sub-options, like e.g., in the RAM case, the user can decide how many ports the memory should have. In the case of multi-dimensional arrays HLS tools also offer ways to partition this array in different dimensions, leading to different memory configurations.

数组综合成RAM或Register时可以指定读写端口数量，多维数组可以指定分割方式

### Functions Synthesis

![hls-function](/assets/images/2024-02-16/hls-function.png)

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
inline  | Every function call is synthesized as its own HW block
operator | Function is encapsulated as FU. User determines how many.
goto    | Single HW block for every function call

> Inlining basically instantiates as separate individual hardware blocks every time that the function is called. Goto does the opposite. A single hardware block is synthesized for that function. Operator on the other hand is a trade-off between both extremes that allows users to control that area vs. performance trade-offs. Basically, the function is encapsulated as a FU and the user can specify in the FU constraint file how many functions it allows the synthesizer to instantiate.

inline函数每次被调用都会生成重复的电路；goto模式为每个函数只生成一个电路，每个时钟周期每个函数最多调用一次；operator模式可以指定为每个函数生成几个电路，作为FU约束每个时钟周期可以调用的次数
