# chisel入门

chisel是一个基于scala的DSL，用于描述电路，可以生成Verilog/SystemVerilog。chisel也算是HLS的一种，类似C/C++/SystemC，使用现代高级语言描述电路，经过编译生成更底层的HDL。

下面是一个闪灯的示例，每50000000个时钟周期内有一半时间亮灯

```scala
class Hello extends Module {
    val io = IO(new Bundle {
        val led = Output(UInt(1.W))
    })

    val CNT_MAX = (50000000 / 2 - 1).U

    val cntReg = RegInit(0.U(32.W))
    val blkReg = RegInit(0.U(1.W))

    cntReg := cntReg + 1.U
    when(cntReg === CNT_MAX) {
        cntReg := 0.U
        blkReg := ˜blkReg
    }

    io.led := blkReg
}
```

## Basic Components

### 数据类型及操作

> Chisel provides three data types to describe connections, combinational logic, and registers: Bits, UInt, and SInt. UInt and SInt extend Bits, and all three types represent a vector of bits. UInt gives this vector of bits the meaning of an unsigned integer and SInt of a signed integer. Chisel uses two’s complement as signed integer representation. The width of a vector of bits is defined by a Chisel width type (Width). 

chisel定义了两个数据类型：UInt和SInt，都继承Bits，表示bit列表，示例如下：

```scala
0.U     // defines a UInt constant of 0
-3.S    // defines a SInt constant of -3

"hff".U     // hexadecimal representation of 255
"o377".U    // octal representation of 255
"b1111_1111".U  // binary representation of 255

// 4-bit的数字3
3.U(4.W) // An 4-bit constant of 3

// 取二进制数3的第4个bit
3.U(4) 
```

> Chisel uses Boolean algebra operators, as they are defined in C, Java, Scala, and several other programming languages, to described combinational circuits: & is the AND operator and | is the OR operator. The resulting width of the operation is the maximum width of the operators for addition and subtraction, the sum of the two widths for the multiplication, and usually the width of the numerator for divide and modulo operations.

UInt和SInt支持基础的运算符，示例如下：

```scala
val and = a & b // bitwise and
val or = a | b  // bitwise or
val xor = a ˆ b // bitwise xor
val not = ˜a    // bitwise negation

val add = a + b // addition
val sub = a - b // subtraction
val neg = -a    // negate
val mul = a * b // multiplication
val div = a / b // division
val mod = a % b // modulo operation
```

![basic-function](/assets/images/2024-02-17/basic-function.png)

UInt和SInt的常用方法如下：

```scala
val w = Wire(UInt())

// 更新值
w := a & b

// 取指定bit
val sign = w(31)

// 取bit向量的一部分
val highByte = w(31, 23)
val lowByte = w(7, 0)

// 连接两个向量
val word = highByte ## lowByte
```

### Multiplexer

> A multiplexer is a circuit that selects between alternatives. In the most basic form, it selects between two alternatives. 

`val result = Mux(sel, a, b)`

> where a is selected when the sel is true.B, otherwise b is selected. The type of sel is a Chisel Bool; the inputs a and b can be any Chisel base type or aggregate (bundles or vectors) as long as they are the same type. 

多播用于根据signal选择signal，类似C语言的`sel ? a : b`

> With logical and arithmetical operations and a multiplexer, every combinational circuit can be described. 

基本数据类型及其操作加上多播可以描述任意组合电路


### Registers

> Chisel provides a register, which is a collection of D flip-flops. The register is implicitly connected to a global clock and is updated on the rising edge. When an initialization value is provided at the declaration of the register, it uses a synchronous reset connected to a global reset signal. A register can be any Chisel type that can be represented as a collection of bits.

chisel的寄存器是一组DFF，不像更底层的Verilog和VHDL那样可以控制clock和reset，寄存器隐式的在clock的上升沿触发变更，如果指定了初始值，则隐式的增加同步的reset

```scala
// 定义reg并指定初始值
val reg = RegInit(0.U(8.W))

// 连接输入信号d
reg := d

// 定义时直接连接输入信号
val nextReg = RegNext(d)

// 同时指定初始值
val bothReg = RegNext(d, 0.U)
```

### Bundle

> A Chisel Bundle groups several signals. The entire bundle can be referenced as a whole, or individual fields can be accessed by their name. A Bundle is similar to a struct in C and SystemVerilog or a record in VHDL. We can define a bundle (collection of signals) by defining a class that extends Bundle and list the fields as vals within the constructor block. 

`Bundle`在结构和作用上都类似C语言的`struct`

```scala
class Channel() extends Bundle {
    val data = UInt(32.W)
    val valid = Bool()
}

val ch = Wire(new Channel())
ch.data := 123.U
ch.valid := true.B
val b = ch.valid
```

### Vec

> A Chisel Vec (a vector) represents a collection of Chisel types of the same type. Each element can be accessed by an index. A Chisel Vec is similar to array data structures in other programming languages.

> A Vec is used for three different purposes: (1) dynamic addressing in hardware, which is a multiplexer; (2) a register file, which includes multiplexing the read and generating the enable signal for the write; (3) parametrization if the number of ports of a Module. For other collections of things, being it hardware elements or other generator data, it is better to use the Scala collection Seq.

Vec表示一组类型相同的元素，常用于寄存器文件、mux等

```scala

// A Vec is created by calling the constructor with two parameters: 
// the number of elements and the type of the elements. 
val v = Wire(Vec(3, UInt(4.W)))

// Individual elements are accessed with (index).
v(0) := 1.U
v(1) := 3.U
v(2) := 5.U
val index = 1.U(2.W)
val a = v(index)

```
