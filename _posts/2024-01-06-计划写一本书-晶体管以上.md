# 背景

> 机缘巧合之下看到了一本书，书名叫`The Elements of Computing Systems`。此书的目录是这样的。

> 摘抄书中部分内容

> It is commonly argued that enlightened people of the twentyfirst century ought to familiarize themselves with the key ideas underlying BANG: Bits, Atoms, Neurons, and Genes. Although science has been remarkably successful in uncovering their basic operating systems, it is quite possible that we will never fully grasp how atoms, neurons, and genes actually work. Bits, however, and computing systems at large, entail a consoling exception: in spite of their fantastic complexity, one can completely understand how modern computers work, and how they are built. So, as we gaze with awe at the BANG around us, it is a pleasing thought that at least one field in this quartet can be fully laid bare to human comprehension. (page-14)

> 21世纪的热点是: 比特、原子、神经、基因，这4者只有比特在当前是可以彻底搞清楚的。

> We wrote this book because we felt that many computer science students are missing the forest for the trees. The typical learner is marshaled through a series of courses in programming, theory, and engineering, without pausing to appreciate the beauty of the picture at large. And the picture at large is such that hardware, software, and application systems are tightly interrelated through a hidden web of abstractions, interfaces, and contract-based implementations. (page-15)

> 很多人在学习计算机时都是只见树木不见森林，只能看到一个点，看不到整个网络。

> 事实上这也是我一直最想突破的。

> We believe that the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch. With that in mind, we came up with the following idea: Let’s specify a simple but sufficiently powerful computer system, and invite learners to build its hardware platform and software hierarchy from the ground up. And while we are at it, let’s do it right. We are saying this because building a general-purpose computer from first principles is a huge enterprise. (page-15)

> 彻底理解整个计算机体系最好的方式是从头构建一个完整的体系。

> 我是非常的赞同这段话，所以才花了4个多月的时间深入了解从晶体管构造cpu的过程。

> You may be thinking: “On my computer, compiling and running programs is much easier—all I have to do is click this icon or write that command!” Indeed, a modern computer system is like a submerged iceberg: most people get to see only the top, and their knowledge of computing systems is sketchy and superficial. If, however, you wish to explore beneath the surface, then Lucky You! There’s a fascinating world down there, made of some of the most beautiful stuff in computer science. An intimate understanding of this underworld is what separates naïve programmers from sophisticated developers—people who can create complex hardware and software technologies. And the best way to understand how these technologies work—and we mean understand them in the marrow of your bones—is to build a complete computer system from the ground up. (page-28)

> 计算机体系好比是一个冰山，大部分人只能看到水面上那一角，区分小白和专家是看他是否能看到冰山下面的部分。

> Starting at the bottom tier of the figure, any general-purpose computer has an architecture that includes a ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and a RAM (Random Access Memory). All ALU and RAM devices are made of elementary logic gates. And, surprisingly and fortunately, as we will soon see, all logic gates can be made from Nand gates alone. Focusing on the software hierarchy, all high-level languages rely on a suite of translators (compiler/interpreter, virtual machine, assembler) for reducing high-level code all the way down to machine-level instructions. Some high-level languages are interpreted rather than compiled, and some don’t use a virtual machine, but the big picture is essentially the same. This observation is a manifestation of a fundamental computer science principle, known as the Church-Turing conjecture: at bottom, all computers are essentially equivalent. (page-29)

> 上图描述了从晶体管到逻辑门，再到cpu，然后到操作系统、编译器、虚拟机、高级语言的过程

> You may wonder how it is humanly possible to construct a complete computer system from the ground up, starting with nothing more than elementary logic gates. This must be a humongous enterprise! We deal with this complexity by breaking the system into modules. Each module is described separately, in a dedicated chapter, and built separately, in a standalone project. You might then wonder, how is it possible to describe and construct these modules in isolation? Surely they are interrelated! As we will demonstrate throughout the book, a good modular design implies just that: you can work on the individual modules independently, while completely ignoring the rest of the system. In fact, if the system is well designed, you can build these modules in any desired order, and even in parallel, if you work in a team. (page-31)

> 一个人如何开发一个完整的计算机系统，答案是模块化

> The cognitive ability to “divide and conquer” a complex system into manageable modules is empowered by yet another cognitive gift: our ability to discern between the abstraction and the implementation of each module. In computer science, we take these words concretely: abstraction describes what the module does, and implementation describes how it does it. With this distinction in mind, here is the most important rule in system engineering: when using a module as a building block—any module—you are to focus exclusively on the module’s abstraction, ignoring completely its implementation details. (page-32)

> 模块分为抽象和实现两部分，抽象描述`what`，实现描述`how`

> In chapter 1 we start with a single logic gate `Nand` and build from it a set of elementary and commonly used logic gates like And, Or, Xor, and so on.  
> In chapters 2 and 3 we use these building blocks for constructing an Arithmetic Logic Unit and memory devices, respectively.   
> In chapter 4 we pause our hardware construction journey and introduce a lowlevel machine language in both its symbolic and binary forms.   
> In chapter 5 we use the previously built ALU and memory units for building a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a Random Access Memory (RAM). These devices will then be integrated into a hardware platform capable of running programs written in the machine language presented in chapter 4.   
> In chapter 6 we describe and build an assembler, which is a program that translates low-level programs written in symbolic machine language into executable binary code.  
> This will complete the construction of the hardware platform. This platform will then become the point of departure for part II of the book, in which we’ll extend the barebone hardware with a modern software hierarchy consisting of a virtual machine, a compiler, and an operating system. (page-36)

# 规划

> 书中从最基础的逻辑门开始，开发了一款16bit的cpu，开发了一款全新的汇编语言，在此基础上开发了一个简易的操作系统，一个类似jvm的虚拟机以及一门类似java的编程语言。然后用类java语言开发了一个俄罗斯方块，所以整个项目旅程被命名为`Nand to Tetris`。

> 我的规划是走一样的路，但是使用成熟的开源项目，裁剪之后得到一个独立的`可执行`程序。从晶体管和逻辑门开始，到一个包含cpu的soc，到kernel和jvm，最终到java web框架spring系列
