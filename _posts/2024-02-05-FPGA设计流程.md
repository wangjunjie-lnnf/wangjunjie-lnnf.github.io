# FPGA设计流程

![fpga-design-flow](/assets/images/2024-02-05/fpga-design-flow.png)

> The figure shows an overview of the complete FPGA synthesis flow starting from a Verilog description that needs to be mapped onto the FPGA. The process starts by synthesizing the Verilog code into a gate netlist through logic synthesis. This gate netlist is then mapped to the FPGA resources through a process called technology mapping and then placing and routing those resources onto the FPGA. Finally the bitstream to program the FPGA is generated.

* **Logic Synthesis**: Converts the RTL code (Verilog or VHDL) into an efficient gate netlist.
* **Technology mapping**: Maps the gate netlist onto FPGA resources. This includes the IOs, the LUTs, DSP macros and BRAM.
* **Place and Route**: This step determines which LE of the FPGA to use, based on different constraints like minimizing the wire-length between connecting to minimize the maximum delay.
* **Bitstream Generation**: This final step generates the FPGA configuration file that is used to program the FPGA.

## Logic Synthesis

> Logic synthesis can be defined as: **The process of converting a hardware description specified at the Register Transfer level (RTL), e.g., Verilog or VHDL into an optimized gate netlist given certain constraints and a target technology library.** 

> 逻辑综合就是把RTL级的硬件规范根据约束转成优化的gate图。

> The constraints given in logic synthesis are typically timing constraints like maximum critical path delay or logic constraints like maximum fanout and maximum logic levels. The technology library contains all of the gate level primitives characterized by their area, timing and power.

> 约束指定了综合过程中要满足的关键路径延迟等条件。库文件包含每个基于门电路的面积、时序、能耗等信息。

## Technology Mapping

> The technology mapping stage takes the optimized gate netlist generated as input and maps it to hardware resources in the FPGA. Basically mapping multipliers to DSP macros, memories to BlockRAM and the rest of the logic to individual LUTs. For this, the technology mapper has to partition the gate netlist into groups of gates that have the same number of inputs as the FPGA LUTs and that generate a single output.

> mapping阶段把优化后的电路图映射到FPGA上，乘法对应内置的乘法器，存储对应到内存的内存块，其他逻辑使用查找表实现。复杂的电路图需要分割使其输入个数和查找表相同。

> 上图(a)描述了一个4输入1输出的电路，上图(b)展示了此电路正好映射到一个查找表。

> 上图(a)描述了一个略微复杂的电路图，8个输入1个输出，超出了一个查找表的范围，所以需要分割。分割的条件是：分割之后每组最多包含4个输入；每组只有一个输出。


## Place and Route

> Once the gate netlist has been mapped to FPGA resources, the place and route stage has to determine where to place these and how to connect them. This process will place the FPGA resources who’s outputs are needed by other resources close together. The routing delay will significantly impact the critical path delay and hence, the maximum frequency at which the FPGA can run.

> 电路图分割完毕后需要决定每组所放的位置，以及各组之间的路由路径，尽量减少路由导致的延迟。


## Bitstream Generation

> This last step encodes all the information generated in the place and route stage and generates a bitstream that configures the individual configuration transistors in the FPGA such that it executes the desired logic function. Because most modern FPGAs are SRAM based, this bitstream needs to be downloaded to a PROM (non-volatile memory) such that every time that the SRAM-based FPGA is turned on, the bitstream is loaded onto the FPGA to configure it.

> 生成的bitstream包含配置信息，需要上传到FPGA的持久化存储，在FPGA启动时加载到内存中以配置电路。
